# Livewire decision

In the context of javascript frameworks, livewire is a bit of an oddball. It is not a full framework like Vue or React, but rather a way to build dynamic interfaces using server-side rendering. It is built on top of Laravel, and allows you to write your frontend code in PHP, while still being able to use some javascript when needed.
I decided to use this pattern, for purely selfish reasons. I had wanted to learn it for a while, and this project seemed like a good opportunity to do so.
